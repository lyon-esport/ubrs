UDP Broadcast Packet Relay
==============================

This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast.
When a packet is received, it sends that packet to all
specified interfaces but the one it came from as though it
originated from the original sender.  

The primary purpose of this is to allow games on machines on
separated local networks (Ethernet, WLAN) that use udp broadcasts
to find each other to do so.

INSTALL
-------
make ; cp udp-broadcast-relay /some/where


USAGE
-----
/some/where/udp-broadcast-relay [-d] [-f] id udp-port eth0 eth1 ...

udp-broadcast-relay must be run as boot to be able to create a raw
socket (necessary) to send packets though they originated from the
original sender)


COMPATIBILITY
-------------
- I run debian woody with Linux 2.4.20, and here it works.


EXAMPLE
-------
/some/where/udp-broadcast-relay 6112  # forward Warcraft 3 broadcast packets
